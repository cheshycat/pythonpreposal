# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

TODO
I thought it'd be cool to make a game, either a text based game or a reimagined version of a classic, preferably megaman, because 
Giorgio tells me it is like mario but with a gun.
## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

TODO
Giorgio Tatarelli

## Do you have any questions of your own?

TODO
So I understood we could take a base game and either revamp it or just like spruce it up with some added features to
'level' up the game, but is it required that we finish all we set out to do? 
Finished as in have it working completely by the end due date?
